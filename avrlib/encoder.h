/// \par Overview
///		This library allows easy interfacing of standard quadrature encoders
///		(used for sensing shaft rotational position and speed) to the Atmel
///		AVR-series processors. The library uses external interrupts to sense
///		and keep track of the encoder's movements. The library is extendable
///		with the maximum number of encoders equal to the total number of
///		external interrupts available on the target AVR processor.
///		
///		\note Due to the wide range of external interrupt capability on
///		AVR processors, it is difficult for this library to automatically
///		adapt to different processors.  For this reason, much of the
///		configuration responsibility has been left with the user.  See
///		the encoderconf.h configuration file.
//
/// \par Operation:
///		Quadrature encoders have two digital outputs usually called PhaseA and
///	PhaseB.  When the encoder rotates, PhaseA and PhaseB produce square wave
///	pulses where each pulse represents a fraction of a turn of the encoder
///	shaft.  Encoders are rated for a certain number of pulses (or counts) per
///	complete revolution of the shaft.  Common counts/revolution specs are 50,
///	100,128,200,250,256,500,etc.  By counting the number of pulses output on
///	one of the phases starting from time0, you can calculate the total
///	rotational distance the encoder has traveled.
///	
/// Often, however, we want current position not just total distance traveled.
/// For this it is necessary to know not only how far the encoder has traveled,
///	but also which direction it was going at each step of the way.  To do this
///	we need to use both outputs (or phases) of the quadrature encoder.
///
///	The pulses from PhaseA and PhaseB on quadrature encoders are always aligned
///	90 degrees out-of-phase (otherwise said: 1/4 wavelength apart).  This
///	special phase relationship lets us extract both the distance and direction
///	the encoder has rotated from the outputs.
///
///	To do this, consider Phase A to be the distance counter.  On each rising
///	edge of PhaseA we will count 1 "tic" of distance, but we need to know the
///	direction.  Look at the quadrature waveform plot below.  Notice that when
///	we travel forward in time (left->right), PhaseB is always low (logic 0) at
///	the rising edge of PhaseA.  When we travel backwards in time (right->left),
///	PhaseB is always high (logic 1) at the rising edge of PhaseA.  Note that
///	traveling forward or backwards in time is the same thing as rotating
///	forwards or bardwards. Thus, if PhaseA is our counter, PhaseB indicates
///	direction.
///
///	Here is an example waveform from a quadrature encoder:
/*
///                /---\   /---\   /---\   /---\   /---\   /---\
///  Phase A:      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
///             ---/   \---/   \---/   \---/   \---/   \---/   \-
///             -\   /---\   /---\   /---\   /---\   /---\   /---
///  Phase B:    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
///              \---/   \---/   \---/   \---/   \---/   \---/
///  Time:    <--------------------------------------------------->
///  Rotate FWD: >----------------------------------------------> 
///  Rotate REV: <----------------------------------------------<
*/
///	To keep track of the encoder position in software, we connect PhaseA to an
///	external processor interrupt line, and PhaseB to any I/O pin.  We set up
///	the external interrupt to trigger whenever PhaseA produces a rising edge.
///	When a rising edge is detected, our interrupt handler function is executed.
///	Inside the handler function, we quickly check the PhaseB line to see if it
///	is high or low.  If it is high, we increment the encoder's position
///	counter, otherwise we decrement it.  The encoder position counter can be
///	read at any time to find out the current position.
